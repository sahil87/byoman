# No Capability Changes

This change is a pure terminology/branding refactor with no new, modified, or removed capabilities.

## Summary

- **No ADDED Requirements**: No new functionality
- **No MODIFIED Requirements**: No behavioral changes
- **No REMOVED Requirements**: No deprecations

All existing specs remain unchanged. The refactor only affects:
- Package naming (`internal/tmux/` → `internal/byobu/`)
- Code comments and documentation
- README terminology

The CLI interface, session management behavior, and all user-facing functionality remain identical.
